import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
import { Redirect, Stack } from 'expo-router';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();

export function RootNavigator() {
  const { deferredLinkProcessed, deferredLink, route } = useDetourContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (deferredLinkProcessed) {
      SplashScreen.hide();
    }
  }, [deferredLinkProcessed]);

  if (!deferredLinkProcessed) {
    return null;
  }

  if (route) {
    return <Redirect href={route} />;
  }

  return <Stack />;
}
```

## Types

The package exposes several types to help you with type-checking in your own codebase.

**Config**

This type is used to define the configuration object you pass to the DetourProvider.

```js
export type Config = {
  /**
   * Your application ID from the Detour dashboard.
   */
  appID: string;

  /**
   * Your API key from the Detour dashboard.
   */
  API_KEY: string;

  /**
   * Optional: A flag to determine if the provider should check the clipboard for a deferred link.
   * When true, it displays permission alert to user.
   * Defaults to true if not provided.
   */
  shouldUseClipboard?: boolean;
};
```

**DeferredLinkContext**

This type represents the object returned by the useDetourContext hook, containing the deferred link and its processing status.

```js
export type DeferredLinkContext = {
  /**
   * Boolean indicating if the deferred link has been processed.
   * This is useful for conditionally rendering UI components.
   */
  deferredLinkProcessed: boolean;

  /**
   * The deferred link value. This can be a string or a URL object, or null if no link was found.
   */
  deferredLink: string | URL | null;

  /**
   * The detected route based on the deferred link, or null if no route was detected.
   */
  route: string | null;
  };
```
