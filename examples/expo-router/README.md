# Detour Expo Router Example

The minimal, recommended starting point for integrating [`@swmansion/react-native-detour`](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/sdk/react-native/sdk-installation) with [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/). `DetourProvider` resolves the incoming link — deferred, Universal/App, or custom scheme — and the `useDetourContext` hook drives navigation straight to the target screen.

## How it works

- `DetourProvider` initialized in `app/_layout.tsx`; `useDetourContext` navigates to `link.pathname` when a link resolves.
- `app/+native-intent.tsx` intercepts Detour domains via `createDetourNativeIntentHandler` before Expo Router routes them.
- Deferred links resolved via clipboard on iOS (`shouldUseClipboard: true`).
- Missing `.env` credentials show a `SetupRequired` screen.

## Test flow

1. Start the app on iOS/Android.
2. You land on `/`.
3. Trigger a Detour Universal/App link resolving to `/details` (see [Triggering links](#triggering-links)).
4. The app navigates directly to the `/details` screen.
5. Go back to `/` — the same link should **not** trigger again.

## Set up Detour

You need a Detour account to register this app and generate its credentials. [Sign up](https://godetour.dev/auth/signup) and open the [Detour Dashboard](https://godetour.dev). If you run into issues during setup, the [Dashboard Walkthrough](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/Fundamentals/dashboard) covers each step in detail.

### 1. Register the app

Create an organization and add a new app. Detour assigns it a base link URL of the form `https://<your-org>.godetour.link/<your-app-hash>`.

→ [Dashboard › Apps](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/Fundamentals/dashboard#apps)

### 2. Configure the platforms

Open **App configuration** and fill the iOS card (Bundle ID, Team ID, App Store ID) and the Android card (package name, SHA-256 certificates). The dashboard generates the `associatedDomains` and intent-filter snippets you paste into `app.json` ([below](#configuring-appjson)).

> For local development (`npx expo run:android`), use the **local debug keystore** fingerprint — not a Play App Signing or EAS key. See [Testing Android App Links](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/sdk/react-native/testing#testing-android-app-links) for more information.

### 3. Copy your credentials

Open **API configuration** and copy your `appID` and publishable `apiKey` into this example's `.env`.

## Configuring app.json

Replace the placeholders in `app.json` with the values from the dashboard's [App configuration](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/Fundamentals/dashboard#app-configuration) section:

- `<your-org>` — your organization slug
- `<your-app-hash>` — the path prefix assigned to your app

<details>
<summary>app.json deep link config</summary>

```json
"ios": {
  "bundleIdentifier": "<your-bundle-identifier>",
  "associatedDomains": ["applinks:<your-org>.godetour.link"]
},
"android": {
  "package": "<your-package>",
  "intentFilters": [{
    "data": [{ "host": "<your-org>.godetour.link", "pathPrefix": "/<your-app-hash>" }]
  }]
}
```

</details>

These same values go into the simulator commands in the next section.

## Triggering links

<details>
<summary>Universal / App link</summary>

Open a Detour link directly from the terminal:

```sh
# iOS simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted "https://<your-org>.godetour.link/<your-app-hash>/details"

# Android emulator
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://<your-org>.godetour.link/<your-app-hash>/details"
```

Alternatively, paste the link into Notes or Messages on the device and tap it — this uses the same OS routing path a real user would.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deferred deep link</summary>

Follow these steps to test the deferred flow:

1. Uninstall the app or clear its data to start from a clean state.
2. Open a Detour link in the device's mobile browser.
3. Install and launch the app — the SDK resolves the link automatically.

> **Note:** On Android, the install referrer is typically unavailable in development builds, so deferred matching falls back to probabilistic signals (IP, device fingerprint) only. See [Limitations & Known Issues](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/Architecture/architecture-limitations).

Alternatively on iOS, you can also copy the link to your clipboard before uninstalling — the SDK reads the clipboard on first launch (`shouldUseClipboard: true`), so you can skip the browser step. It simulates a link clicked before the app was installed.

## Quick start

- Install dependencies from the repo root: `pnpm install`
- Configure this app in the [Detour Dashboard](https://godetour.dev) using identifiers from `app.json` (for example `ios.bundleIdentifier`, `android.package`).
- Use the values from the dashboard's [API configuration](https://detour.swmansion.com/docs/Fundamentals/dashboard#api-configuration-and-key-security) section to fill `.env` and update `app.json` with the generated integration code.
- Run prebuild for this example: `pnpm prebuild`
- Start the example: `pnpm start`
- Run on device/simulator: `pnpm ios` or `pnpm android`
